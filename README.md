### Introduction
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source, web-based interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports multiple programming languages, most commonly Python, making it a versatile tool for data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and academic research. Jupyter notebooks offer an intuitive interface for writing code and immediately viewing its output, making them ideal for experimentation and teaching. Additionally, they allow for easy integration of multimedia elements and can be shared in formats like HTML or PDF. This platform is widely used by data scientists, researchers, and educators due to its flexibility and real-time collaboration capabilities.

### Prerequisites
1. **Python (version 3.3 or greater)**
      a. Jupyter Notebook primarily runs on Python, so you'll need Python installed on your system.  
      b. Python 3.6 or later is recommended.  
      c. To check if Python is installed, run this command in your terminal or command prompt:
   
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```  
      d. If Python isn't installed, you can download and install it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **`pip` (Python package manager)**
      a. Pip is the package manager for Python and is used to install Jupyter Notebook and other Python libraries.  
      b. To check if pip is installed, run:
   
      ```bash
      pip --version
      ```
3. **Internet connection**

## Procedure
1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**  
   a. Open your terminal or command prompt and run
   
    ```bash
    pip install notebook


3. **Check Jupyter Version**

   ```bash
   jupyter â€“-version

4. **Run Juypter**
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
